This capstone project was created under NDA, so I am not able to show all of the original code, however I have included my slide inserts for a portion of the full project I worked on to show a snippet of what I contributed. This project included giving the client the ability to internally access their full DNS records through a web application that programmatically accessed the client's major Amazon Route53 account. OAuth was used as an authorization tool to confirm their employees authorized accounts based on a Microsoft storage table and key vault combo for access to ciritical data. My major contributions were making sure we were accessing the correct DNS records via comparing the URL input by the user to API callback from Amazon, and making sure people weren't able to get to DNS records they shouldn't have access to via URL redirects or inputs.
