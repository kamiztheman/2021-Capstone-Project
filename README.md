This capstone project was created under NDA, so I am not able to show all of the original code, however I have included my slide inserts used to present our project to the company's CTO and my professor, to show a snippet of what I contributed. This project included giving the client the ability to internally access their full DNS records through a web application that programmatically accessed the company's major Amazon Route53 account. OAuth was used as an authorization tool to confirm the employee's authorized accounts based on a Microsoft storage table and key vault combo for access to criitical data. My major contributions were making sure we were accessing the correct DNS records via comparing the URL input by the user to API callback from Amazon, and making sure employee's weren't able to access DNS records they shouldn't have access to via URL redirects or invalid inputs.
